# OLDI

OLDI - Open library database interface is a sqlite3 database managing GUI, aimed at increasing productivity and reliability for school libraries.

OLDI is written in python with the help of the sqlite3 and PyQt5 libraries. The database is stored locally, with the option to upload backup versions of it to Google Drive.

# Reasons I made this

While participating at a volunteering event at our highschool, with the purpose of renovating the library, I have found that the librarian stores the books inside an excel spreadsheet(yeah, in an informatics-oriented highschool). 

I haven't really been able to find a tool that was simple enough to use, yet customised to the demands of our librarian. So I decided to make my own database interface.

# Reasons for the libraries that I use

## Sqlite3
I chose to use a local database, because I didn't really have a spare server to host an online database. Also, their FAQ bought me:
> For device-local storage with low writer concurrency and less than a terabyte of content, SQLite is almost always a better solution. SQLite is fast and reliable and it requires no configuration or maintenance. It keeps things simple. SQLite "just works".
